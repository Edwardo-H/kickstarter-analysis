### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
---
By using a pivot table, one can summarize the raw kickstarter data to focus on crowdfunding projects found in the Parent Category "theater" (which includes the Subcategory "plays") and filtered by years/months. Furthermore, one can break down which of these projects were successful, which failed, and which were canceled.

#### Results

Conclusion:

1. Based on the chart created from the data, one would likely come to the conclusion that April through August appear to be the best months to launch a theater related crowdfunding campaign with the most successful campaigns peaking in May. It is worth noting that February could be an outlier with above average successful campaigns.
2. While failed campaigns also peaked in May, October showed a noticeable uptick in failed campaigns on the chart from the prior month.

Limitations:

While the line chart appears to suggest that Louise should begin her crowdfunding campaign in the middle of year, preferably May, it is difficult to accept the reliability of this conclusion based on the analysis that was performed.
