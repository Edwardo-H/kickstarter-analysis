### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

By using a pivot table, one can summarize the raw kickstarter data to focus on crowdfunding projects found in the Parent Category "theater" (which includes the Subcategory "plays") and also filter by years/months. Furthermore, one can break down which of these projects were successful, which failed, and which were canceled.
